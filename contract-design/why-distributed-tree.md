  What were the primary reasons for us to choose Distributed Tree over the other
  less complex architectures.

# Why Distributed Tree?

### Accessibility

While all architectures allowed users to interact with the name system from anywhere, they did however either limit the featureset or at least add a cost to using it on other chains.

With this architecture the hub chain has only a very limited edge over other chains, all chains are essentially equal.

### Integrating into the existing ecosystem

When every name can be managed from every chain we are able to all users of other name systems to get the same name within our system.&#x20;

While the extend to which we will use this is still open for discussion, the technical capabilities do exist.

### Efficiency

While some operations will require a ton of GMP usage we estimate that the average user will rarely run into those operations and will get away with the lowest possible cost.
