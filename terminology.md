ENS Terminology

* Parent (Node):
* Responsible Parent (Node):
* Child (Node):
* Link: Is a Node record which is pointing to another chain. A Link has no direct owner and holds no information. Every subname of a parent has a separate Link entry and can be managed individual
* GMP: Axelar's General Message Passing (GMP) enables a developer building on one chain to call any function on any other connected chain. More on that you can find here [https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/gmp-overview](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/gmp-overview)
