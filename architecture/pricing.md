# Pricing

In the current market, there are two pricing models. Buy and Rent.

With Buy, there are massive problems with names being blocked or locked. This blocking doesn't even have to be intentional, but it still happens. Names that are simply no longer in use, or users who have lost their access, these types of names are lost forever and cannot be recovered. There are systems in place to undo or prevent this, but then you no longer own the name and can rent it instead. The other aspect is that the prices for just testing the name would be very high and discourage new users from joining.

But renting doesn't solve everything, there are clear problems with an uncontrolled, free, open mark. So we decide to go with the ENS approach and the Exponential Dutch Auction. We find that the ENS system is generally a good idea and the best approach for the current situation.
