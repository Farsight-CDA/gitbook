# Vision #Draft

## Accessibility

Our name system should be usable from as many chains as possible, no noticable feature drawbacks to being one over the other.

This also means that name ownership can be held on other chains, not just a single one. Including trading, managing sub-names and resolver records.

## Pricing

Our pricing model must be fair while not allowing for name hoarding / other abuse.\
... ToDo

## Namespace Clashing

We will restrict ourselves to just one tld and accept other tld's in crypto and outside of it (DNS).\
It should be architecturally possible to import other name systems / allow owners of names in other systems to claim their name in Farsight.
