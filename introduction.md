# Introduction

Farsight-names aims to be a cross-chain address tagging service. More and more of the crypto world is shifting to cross-chain applications, for more flexibility and more ...

This means providing a service that resolves human-understandable names (non-literal.far). Due to increasing applications and more complex navigation, we want to standardise and allow the user to abstract. Right now there are more opportunities than ever to build cross-chain, many applications from the old days are being modernised or pushed out of the market by newer improved platforms.



### State of development

we are a team of two developers, as a team we have applied for Long Hash and are looking for funding. At the moment we are extending the DNS system for cross-chain use cases. We are also working on a concept for a full system with full NFT standards and full cross-chain compatibility with in deps subdomain and DNS integrations.
